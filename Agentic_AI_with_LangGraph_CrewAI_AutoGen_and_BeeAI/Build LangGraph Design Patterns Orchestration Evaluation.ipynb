    "Estimated time needed: **30** minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you'll master two fundamental agentic design patterns that power modern AI workflows. You'll build a parallel meal planning system that coordinates multiple AI chefs, and an iterative investment advisor that refines recommendations through continuous feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world impact**: These patterns are used in production systems at leading companies such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, and Google—enabling AI agents to collaborate, self-improve, and tackle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks across domains from research to customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI systems take on more complex problems, a critical challenge arises:  \n",
    "**How can we coordinate multiple agents or components to work collaboratively, intelligently, and adaptively?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **LangGraph** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** is a framework for building **stateful, dynamic, and modular AI workflows**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional linear chains, LangGraph enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔄 **Iterative refinement**: Incorporate feedback loops and self-correction logic  \n",
    "- 🧵 **Conditional routing**: Dynamically choose different paths based on intermediate results  \n",
    "- ⚡️ **Parallel execution**: Process independent subtasks concurrently to boost efficiency  \n",
    "- 🧠 **Global state management**: Maintain and evolve shared context across complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "With LangGraph, your workflows become more than just pipelines; they become **intelligent systems** capable of reasoning, adapting, and improving over time. This is **ideal** for use cases such as multi-agent collaboration, decision-making, evaluation loops, and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be loosely following [this](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#orchestrator-worker) LangGraph tutorial throughout this lab.\n",

    "# Orchestrator-Worker Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator-worker pattern is a powerful approach for handling complex, unpredictable tasks by dynamically **breaking them into manageable pieces** and **processing them in parallel**. When you can't predict upfront how many subtasks you'll need or what they'll involve, this pattern shines by intelligently **analyzing** the input, **decomposing** it into structured work units, and **assigning** specialized workers to handle each piece independently. This pattern is widely used in real-world AI workflow systems, including industry solutions such as IBM’s [Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-Agentic+Design+Patterns+in+LangGraph-v1_1752612018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a busy catering kitchen that takes orders for large events—when a customer orders \"I want a three-course meal, hamburgers for lunch, and pizza for dinner,\" the head chef (orchestrator) analyzes the request and breaks it down into specific dishes, then assigns specialized culinary consultants to create detailed meal plans for each cuisine. Each consultant specializes in a specific cuisine, for example, one expert in Italian cuisine handles the pizza planning, while an American cuisine specialist develops the hamburger menu. The key is that each consultant receives a **clear, structured brief** with dish requirements and dietary considerations, not just \"plan something good.\" In our meal planning system, user requests such as \"feed my family for the week\" could result in anywhere from 3 to 15 different dishes, each requiring a specialist consultant's expertise in their particular cuisine to create comprehensive meal plans.\n",

The `StateGraph` defines how those nodes are connected and how data (state) flows between them. In a `StateGraph`, the input state travels through the workflow getting updated at each state, this is why the naming convention of the state remains consistent throughout the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the graph** with a `State` schema that defines what information will persist and evolve across the workflow.\n",
    "2. **Add nodes** using `.add_node(name, function)`, where each node operates on a portion of the state.\n",
    "    - `orchestrator`, `chef_worker`, and `synthesizer`\n",
    "4. **Connect the nodes** using:\n",
    "   - `.add_edge(from_node, to_node)` for simple sequential steps\n",
    "   - `.add_conditional_edges(...)` for dynamic routing or parallel fan-out\n",
    "5. **Compile the graph** to finalize structure and validation.\n"

      "📝 Evaluator Feedback:\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "This investment strategy is classified as aggressive due to its high allocation (75%) to equities, primarily focused on growth stocks and emerging markets, which inherently carry significant volatility and risk. The plan emphasizes potential high returns through exposure to high-growth sectors and thematic investments, aligning with the investor's high-risk tolerance. However, this approach lacks sufficient capital preservation measures and may not provide a margin of safety, which could lead to substantial losses during market downturns. Regular monitoring and a cash position for liquidity are positive points, but the overall strategy leans heavily towards speculative investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "📃 Final Investment Plan:\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "### Revised Investment Strategy for High-Risk Tolerance Investor\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investor Profile:**\n",
      "- Age: 29\n",
      "- Salary: $110,000\n",
      "- Assets: $40,000\n",
      "- Goal: Achieve financial independence by age 45\n",
      "- Risk Tolerance: High\n",
      "\n",
      "**Objective:**\n",
      "Targeting a 15% annual return with a more aggressive approach to capitalize on growth opportunities while maintaining a diverse and dynamic portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Investment Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Equity Allocation (75%)**\n",
      "   - **Growth Stocks (50%)**: \n",
      "     - Focus on sectors like technology, biotechnology, and renewable energy. \n",
      "     - Invest in ETFs that track growth indices (e.g., Nasdaq-100 ETF).\n",
      "   - **Emerging Markets (25%)**: \n",
      "     - Allocate to ETFs focused on high-growth regions (Asia, Latin America).\n",
      "     - Consider thematic ETFs targeting disruptive technologies in emerging markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Alternative Investments (15%)**\n",
      "   - **Commodities (5%)**: \n",
      "     - Invest in commodity ETFs that track precious metals (gold, silver) and energy (oil, natural gas) to hedge against inflation.\n",
      "   - **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) (10%)**: \n",
      "     - Focus on growth-oriented REITs that can provide income and capital appreciation, particularly in sectors like technology and healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Fixed Income (10%)**\n",
      "   - **TIPS (5%)**: \n",
      "     - Include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities to guard against inflation.\n",
      "   - **High-Yield Bonds (5%)**: \n",
      "     - Allocate a smaller portion to high-yield corporate bonds for added income, accepting higher risk for potential higher returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **Cash Position (5%)**\n",
      "   - Maintain a small cash position (5%) for liquidity and to capitalize on market opportunities as they arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Adjustments Based on Feedback:\n",
      "- **Increased Growth Equity Allocation**: Shift from 60% to 75% in equities, with a strong focus on growth and emerging markets to align with high-risk tolerance and aggressive return targets.\n",
      "- **Reduced Emphasis on Established Companies**: Move away from a conservative bias towards established dividend-paying stocks, focusing instead on high-growth sectors.\n",
      "- **Enhanced Alternative Investments**: Increase exposure to REITs and commodities to provide growth potential and inflation protection while diversifying risk.\n",
      "- **Simplified Bond Strategy**: Limit fixed income to TIPS and high-yield bonds, avoiding traditional government bonds to maintain a higher growth trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Considerations:\n",
      "1. **Regular Monitoring and Rebalancing**: Review the portfolio quarterly to ensure allocations remain aligned with market conditions and performance targets. Adjust based on economic scenarios (e.g., inflation, growth acceleration).\n",
      "2. **Leverage Consideration**: For qualified investors, consider using margin for investments in growth sectors if market conditions are favorable and volatility is manageable.\n",
      "3. **Education and Awareness**: Continue to educate on market trends, especially in emerging markets and high-growth sectors, to leverage opportunities effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "This revised strategy is designed to align more closely with your high-risk tolerance while targeting the desired 15% return. By focusing on aggressive growth assets, diversifying into alternatives, and maintaining a strategic equity-heavy portfolio, you are positioned to take advantage of favorable economic conditions as you work toward achieving financial independence by age 45.\n"

    "   - Parallel task execution by independent worker nodes  \n",
    "   - Automatic state merging via `Annotated` fields\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reflection Pattern**  \n",
    "   - Iterative generate–evaluate loops inspired by real investor personas  \n",
    "   - Structured feedback using Pydantic output parsers  \n",
    "   - Conditional routing to refine or accept results until they meet targets\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Management & Routing**  \n",
    "   - A shared `State` schema carrying context across nodes  \n",
    "   - Flexible fan-out and conditional edges (`Send`, `add_conditional_edges`)  \n",
    "   - Loop control via iteration counters and routing logic\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization & Testing**  \n",
    "   - Mermaid diagrams for graph structure inspection  \n",

    "- **Check out [Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-Agentic+Design+Patterns+in+LangGraph-v1_1752612018)**: AI Agents for business to automate and handle simple tasks using orchestration.\n",
    "- **Extend the Patterns**: Try the optimizer (plan–evaluate) pattern or combine reflection with reinforcement learning.\n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation**: Swap out the grocery-list or investment example for customer support, legal drafting, or robotic control.\n",
    "- **Monitoring & Metrics**: Instrument your graph with logging, latency tracking, and success/failure metrics.\n",
    "- **Error Handling & Robustness**: Add retry policies, fallback nodes, and alerting for production readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these design patterns—**orchestration**, **evaluation**, **reflection**, and **routing**—you can create truly **agentic systems** that plan, critique, adapt, and improve over time. \n",
