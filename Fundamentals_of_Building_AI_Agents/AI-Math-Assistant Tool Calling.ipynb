The agent first noticed that one of the inputs was the word \"two\" instead of a number, so it converted \"two\" to its numeric form, which is 2. After preparing the list of numbers (10, 20, 2, and 30), the agent decided to use the `AddTool` to perform the addition.

    "## Orchestrating multiple tools with an agent: Mathematical toolkit\n",
    "In real-world applications, a single tool is often insufficient to address the complexity and diversity of user requests. Tasks such as data analysis, performing calculations, or retrieving specific information require specialized capabilities that cannot be fulfilled by a single function. By equipping an agent with multiple tools, each tailored to a distinct purpose, you'll create a system that can dynamically select and utilize the appropriate tool based on the user’s query. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the AI, allowing it to handle a broad spectrum of tasks with precision and efficiency. The orchestration of multiple tools ensures that the agent can seamlessly manage complex workflows, making it an essential framework for building robust and versatile AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this concept, let’s create additional tools, i.e, a mathematical toolkit. In addition to the addition tool, you will now create tools for subtraction, multiplication, and division. These tools will be integrated into an agent capable of handling various mathematical queries, showcasing how multiple tools can work together within a single AI system.\n",
